# 🧠 Dementia Detection Using EEG  

## 📌 Overview  
Built a CNN-LSTM model to classify EEG signals into Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Healthy Controls.  
Achieved ~94% accuracy using class-weighted training, outperforming baseline ML models.

## 📂 Dataset  
- EEG resting-state, eyes-closed recordings from **88 subjects** (AD, FTD, and Healthy Controls).  
- Source: [OpenNeuro ds004504 v1.0.8](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.8)  
- Preprocessing: filtering, downsampling, normalization.

## 🚀 How to Build / Extend  
If you want to build from this project, you can:  
- Use the provided preprocessing pipeline to prepare EEG data for training.  
- Modify the CNN-LSTM architecture (e.g., add attention layers or dropout tuning).  
- Experiment with other deep learning models (e.g., Transformers for EEG, 1D-CNN only).  
- Try different segmentation strategies (longer windows, overlapping samples).  
- Apply the same framework to other EEG datasets for generalization.
